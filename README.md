# The-System
Metroidvania Concept

In this post-apocalyptic 2D Metroidvania game, a scrapper explores the ruined world to find his missing brother, overcoming enemies and obstacles with the help of allies he finds along the way.

As the player progresses through the world they unlock more characters to add to their party as well as upgrades to existing powers.
